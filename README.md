Expert Finder bot allows employees to search for other individuals in an organization based on their skills, interests and schools. In addition, it also provides users the ability to update their profile information and keep it up to date.

**Expert Finder bot**
 - **My Profile**: Using this command users will be able to view their Azure Active Directory profile information in a card. The card will have call to action buttons that will let them add or modify information in their Azure Active Directory profile or view details about other attributes.
